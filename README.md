# Text-based *Hunt the Wumpus* game made in Prolog

## Installation

On Mac:

```
git clone https://github.com/adieu2/wumpus-prolog.git
brew install swi-prolog
cd wumpus-prolog
swipl wumpus.pl
start.
```

I did not test the code on Windows or Linux. In both cases you will need [swi-prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) and it should work, but if you have any problem please raise an issue.

## What is *Hunt the Wumpus*?

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus) (June 26th 2021):

> Hunt the Wumpus is a text-based adventure game developed by Gregory Yob in 1973. In the game, the player moves through a series of connected caves, arranged as the vertices of a dodecahedron, as they hunt a monster named the Wumpus. The turn-based game has the player trying to avoid fatal bottomless pits and "super bats" that will move them around the cave system; the goal is to fire one of their "crooked arrows" through the caves to kill the Wumpus. Yob created the game in early 1973 due to his annoyance at the multiple hide-and-seek games set in caves in a grid pattern, and it and multiple variations were sold via mail order by Yob and the People's Computer Company. The source code to the game was published in Creative Computing in 1975 and republished in The Best of Creative Computing the following year.

I discovered this game while reading [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/). The version made in this repository was made in Prolog.
